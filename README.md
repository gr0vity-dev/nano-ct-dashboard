# Nano Continuous Testing Dashboard

## Overview
The Nano Continuous Testing Dashboard is a tool designed to visualize and analyze the results of automated tests run on every commit and pull request in the [nanocurrency/nano-node repository](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-node). It assists in maintaining code quality and swiftly identifying and addressing issues in the codebase.

## Features
* **Latest test results**: The dashboard displays the most recent test results for each commit and pull request in the nanocurrency/nano-node repo.
* **Filter by commit hash**: Results can be filtered based on the commit hash, allowing developers to focus on specific changes.
* **Code browsing**: By clicking on a commit hash, developers are directed to Github to view the actual code changes for that specific commit.
* **Time tracking**: The dashboard not only tracks the time elapsed since each test, but also displays the duration of each testcase and its deviation from the median duration.
